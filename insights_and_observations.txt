Firstly, pre processed the data by handling missing values and scaling it.
Filled all the missing text values by mode of data and integral data by mean of the data.
Encoded all the text type data into integral values using label encoder.
Scaled all the data.
Applied knn regression and predicted evaluation metrics.
calculated error percentage in predicted data and root mean squared error.
reduced error a bit by removing those columns which had too many null values and were irrelevant for price prediction.
plotted Sale prics vs each feature graphs to understand how each feature is related to our sale price,
for example sale price is directly increasing on increasing 'OverAllQual' feature.
similary, features like 'condition 2' does'nt rally affect sale price as we are getting different sale prices on same 'condition2' value.
calculated correlation matrix which does the same thing as above but instead of visualisation it gives a score between -1 and 1 and describes the relevency of that feature.
calculated best k for k means by calculating wcss for each k using elbow method.
applied k-means on top 10 relevent feature and sale price.
1 st row of the plots shows us the clustered data for sale price vs each feature.
list of top 10 relevent features - ['OverallQual', 'GrLivArea', 'GarageCars', 'ExterQual', 'GarageArea', 'BsmtQual', 'TotalBsmtSF', '1stFlrSF', 'KitchenQual', 'FullBath']
